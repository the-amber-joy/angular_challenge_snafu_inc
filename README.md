ALL RIGHT! Set up a *NEW* project! From the ground up.
Bring in Angular, that's all we will need for our project today.

## Business Need:
I am the CTO at Snafu Inc. and here at Snafu we want all of our developers to be internet famous. Our trouble is our developers aren't the creative types and have ended up with handles like [@joeltmiller](http://www.twitter.com/joeltmiller) (no bueno).


## Technical Requirements
Our application will randomly generate Twitter handles using two lists of 10 (one being adjectives and one being nouns). These two JSON lists should be retrieved from two different Express endpoints using [$http](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$http).

You should end up with 10 unique twitter handles that will link out to there actual twitter page (so we can check if it's taken, duh). Check [this](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngHref) out. 

## Hard Mode:
Style your application with Bootstrap

## Pro Mode:
Add animations to your list of handles

Once again, the functionality should be similar to what we built in class. NO COPY PASTING CODE from other projects, hand write it.
